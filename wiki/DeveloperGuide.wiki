How Do I Checkout Code From Eclipse (for command line see Source tab above):

I'll assume that you have done the following:

  * Install the latest version of Eclipse.
  * Install the Android SDK.
  * Install the ADT plug-in for Eclipse.
  * Install the subversion plug-in for Eclipse Subclipse (the one we use).

Projects require a classpath variable called "ANDROID_LIB" to be set to the location of an android.jar file in your SDK directory. For example, on my machine it is set to "/home/user/Desktop/android/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.6_r1/platforms/android-2.1/android.jar" because I extracted the SDK to "/home/user/Desktop/android/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.6_r1". You can set classpath variables in Eclipse by going to:
Window menu -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables
