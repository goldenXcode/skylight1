How Do I Checkout Code From Eclipse (for command line see Source tab above)?

Prerequisites:
  * Install the latest version of Eclipse.
  * Install the Android SDK.
  * Install the ADT plug-in for Eclipse.
  * Install the a subversion plug-in for Eclipse (we recommend Subclipse).

Some projects require a classpath variable called "ANDROID_LIB" to be set to the location of an android.jar file in your SDK directory.

For example, if you installed the SDK to "/home/user/Desktop/android/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.6_r1/" the the variable should point to: "/home/user/Desktop/android/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.6_r1/platforms/android-2.1/android.jar". 

You can set classpath variables in Eclipse by going to:
Window menu -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables

Note: some projects may require the Android NDK (only those with jni folders).


To check out a project, open the SVN Repository view in Eclipse right click on a project (for demos drill down first to the project) then simply use default checkout..:  "check out as project..."
