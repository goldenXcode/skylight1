= Skylight Use Case =

*Description:* The user plays the game.

*Primary Actor:* Two or more users.

*Primary Flow:*
||1||The user launches the Skylight game.||
||2||The system presents instructions to the current user (in example game, via a video)||
||3||The system introduces the game and provides an option to start a game at a level (e.g. easy, medium, hard).||
||4||The user selects the option to start a game.||
||5||The user holds the device such that the camera is obscured. (deprecated)||
||6||The system provides a three second _start count-down_, and then begins to communicate to the user how the device must be moved, and shows a _passing count-down_. (deprecated)||
||7||The user plays the skill test game for n (15) seconds ||
||8||The system presents the user with a success animation, and then resumes at step 6 with the new user and skill level is increased.||

*Alternate Flow: User aborts during the _start count-down_* (deprecated)
||6a||The user removes their hand prior to the end of the _start count-down_.||
||6b||The system resumes the primary flow at step 4.||

*Alternate Flow: User does not complete the pass before the _passing count-down_ completes* (deprecated)
||7a||The user does not unobscure the camera by the end of the _passing count-down_.||
||7b||The system begins a timed-out animation, indicating that the current user has lost the game.  Once the animation is complete, the system resumes the primary flow at step 2.||

*Alternate Flow: User moves the device inappropriately* (deprecated)
||7a||The user moves the device inappropriately (unsteady hand, wrong direction, wrong orientation, etc.)||
||7b||The system begins an unsteady-hand animation, indicating that the current user has lost the game.  Once the animation is complete, the system resumes the primary flow at step 2.||
